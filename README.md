This repo contains Python notebooks for analysis of blood vessel diameter in Python.

## Blood-vessel-graphs.ipynb

This notebook takes in diameter-over-time data and generates graphs from the line profiles of each "pulse" of a treatment.

## AUC_largest_percent_area.ipynb

This notebook takes in the data generated by an area-under-the-curve analysis performed in GraphPad PRISM and extracts the data for the peak with the largest percent area.
